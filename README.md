## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size


## My process

- This preview card was challenging, especially the media screens and make it responsive. The goal is to have a preview card that respond based on the viewer's screen. The sizing, however, I realized, is easy when I use the chrome extension PerfectPixel and thanks to the developers and the mentors here in Frontend Mentor that shared this golden nugget with me. I can practice how to be accurate as much as possible with the designs provided in Figma or any other tools to design a website. 

I use the basic language to create this website, using HTML and CSS. I was thinking on using Tailwind or Bootstrap and choose between the two CSS frameworks. However, upon studying these frameworks, CSS is much flexible for me when it comes to designing practice websites like this. Tailwind and Bootstrap offers fast coding process but with generic outputs, in my opinion, and I also realized that it is mostly valuable when it comes to creating business websites fast (and designs are just simple). It's just my opinion, but for the next project, I'll try to use Tailwind/Bootstrap CSS to prove myself wrong.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned how to put a color above the image by putting the image inside a div container and then applying the properties on that container using "background" property and using opacity property to adjust the color (from light to dark).
